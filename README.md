# lh-caches

The last fews WoW expansions have included handing out caches as quest rewards and drops. These tend to accumulate in your bags and can easily be overlooked. Opening the cache requires rummaging thru you bags to find the cache and click on it.

This addon aims to make this process easier. It scans your bags for eligible caches, and places a button on your UI that you can click to open the cache.
